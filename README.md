**Arithmetic Expression Processing in Java: Infix to Binary Tree and Tree Traversal**

**Description:**
This Java program takes a fully parenthesized infix arithmetic expression as input and performs two main tasks. Firstly, it converts the infix expression into a binary expression tree, facilitating a hierarchical representation of the expression's structure. The program utilizes custom stacks for characters and TreeNodes to manage the conversion process. Secondly, it includes tree traversal algorithms to output the expression in prefix, infix, and postfix formats, offering a comprehensive exploration of tree traversal techniques.

**Infix to Binary Tree Conversion:**
The program uses custom stacks to iteratively process the input infix expression, building a binary expression tree step by step. It handles operands, operators, and parentheses, ensuring the correct representation of the expression's structure. The conversion process is accompanied by step-by-step output, displaying the evolving stacks at each stage.

**Tree Traversal Algorithms:**
The program features three tree traversal algorithms: infix, prefix, and postfix. These algorithms traverse the binary expression tree and output the corresponding expressions in the desired formats. The main method provides test cases with diverse infix expressions, demonstrating the versatility of the program.

**Key Features:**

1) Custom Stacks for Operand Nodes and Operators.
2) Step-by-Step Output during Infix to Binary Tree Conversion.
3) Tree Traversal Algorithms: Prefix, Infix, and Postfix.
4) Test Cases for Varied Infix Expressions.
5) Error Handling for Parenthesis Mismatch.

**Sample Outputs:**
The program outputs the binary expression tree and the expressions in prefix, infix, and postfix formats for each test case, showcasing the effectiveness of the conversion and traversal algorithms.

This program serves as a comprehensive tool for understanding the conversion of infix expressions to binary trees and the subsequent traversal of these trees to obtain various expression formats. The step-by-step output and diverse test cases contribute to a thorough exploration of arithmetic expression processing in Java.
