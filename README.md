**Merging Singly Linked Lists to Doubly Linked List in Java**

**Description:**
The Java program, `MergeLists`, efficiently merges two ordered singly linked lists of integers into a single ordered doubly linked list, eliminating duplicate elements. The program provides a comprehensive demonstration, including standard test cases and special cases. It incorporates a `DoublyLinkedList` class for handling the doubly linked list and ensures bidirectional traversal.

**Key Features:**

1. **Ordered List Merging:**
   - The program uses a merging algorithm to combine two ordered singly linked lists into a single ordered doubly linked list.
   - Duplicates are handled intelligently to ensure the resulting list contains unique elements.

2. **Bidirectional Traversal:**
   - The `DoublyLinkedList` class supports both forward and reverse traversal, showcasing the bidirectional nature of doubly linked lists.
   - The `display` method prints elements in the forward direction, while `displayReverse` prints elements in reverse.

3. **Test Cases:**
   - The program includes test cases demonstrating scenarios where one or both lists are empty, elements occur in both lists, and general ordered merging.

4. **Time and Space Complexity Analysis:**
   - A detailed explanation of the time and space complexity of the merging algorithm and other data structures used in the program is provided.
   - The time complexity is O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of the input linked lists, and the space complexity is also O(m + n).
